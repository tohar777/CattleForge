---------------------------------IMPORTANT NOTES----------------------------------


Unsupported Resources Detected:
The following resource types were detected in the project that conversion is not implemented for yet.
See Export Report to see which resources were not exported.
You will still be able to edit the project in the editor regardless.
 - Resource Type: FontFile, Format: png

------
Experimental Scene Export:
Scene export is EXPERIMENTAL and exported scenes may be inaccurate.
Thus, all exported scenes have been saved to the .assets directory, which will not be picked up by the editor for import.
Please report any issues you encounter with exported scenes to the Github page Github.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use Godot editor version 4.4.1 to edit the project.
Note: the project may be using a custom version of Godot. Detection for this has not been implemented yet.
If you find that you have many non-import errors upon opening the project 
(i.e. scripts or shaders have many errors), use the original game's binary as the export template.
